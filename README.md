When using the game please download the right file for what operating system you are on. The currently supported OS are Windows 10 and Linux (only distros that are based of ubuntu).
Macs will be supported soon. If it does run on any other OS, please open up a Github issue so I can add the OS to the supported OS list.

To play the game on windows 10, please follow the following instructions:
1. Download the zip file that says "windows 10"
2. Then unzipp the zip file
3. Click the .exe file that is named "main"

To play the game on linux, please follow the following instructions:
1. Download the zip file that says "linux"
2. Then unzipp the zip file
3. then open up terminal and change the file path to where you unzipped the game
4. the run the following command: c++ main.cpp -o main; ./main

If there is any errors or questions please raise a github issue so I can help you.
